    <h2>How i am?</h2>
    <p>
        Hello, I am Muhammad, a graduate of the Faculty of Computer Science. I seek to gain experience in programming. I
        have enthusiasm and passion for work. I have experience in making projects because my graduation project was
        Android and I implemented it professionally without having a background in this field - the end of the
        conversation. I can always find a solution
    </p>

    <h3>General information</h3>

    <p>
        In general, I love simplicity in everything, I love coordinating shapes and colors, and I adore 3D sites. I am
        still a beginner and I am developing to be a professional in these sites.
    </p>
    <h3>Functionality</h3>
    <p>
        Parallax scrolling can be created in different ways on websites. In general, background images and
        visual
        elements are inserted in the foreground so that the viewer can move through the landscape via the scroll
        function. The global image or the visible area above the fold is the landmark - also called viewport -
        for
        the viewer: the website moves, so to speak, from this fixed landmark, while the individual elements move
        more slowly and quickly. These movements are caused by Slides, Fade out, Fade in and fixed elements such
        as
        text or graphics loaded continuously via so-called HTML Reflow. The arrangement of the partly animated
        elements on the parallax scroll leads to a dynamic display of the website contents: the user
        "experiences"
        the contents as they move horizontally.
    </p>
    <p>
        The website itself is, from the point of view of its design, often a Single Page or OnePager website:
        source
        code, texts, images, CSS and scripts are in one and the same document filed on a server. The effects are
        controlled via selectors and CSS tags, the requests are managed by the effects, after being triggered by
        the
        user who has scrolled the page. In the case of multiple scripts, very detailed graphics, high resolution
        images or high rendering, the loading time of the content can be longer than expected. For this reason,
        it
        is advisable to use effects only in a subtle way and it is always better to choose a light source code.
        Ideally, parallax scrolling is part of the overall website concept, which can also be a multi-page
        website
        for targeted use.
    </p>
    <h3>In practice</h3>
    <p>
        The most common use case is storytelling. Here, the contents are arranged in a way that tells a story -
        while the user scrolls down the page. The range of information and the technical representation of the
        contents are combined. Freelancers, websites, online stores, landing pages with many calls to action,
        product launch websites and advertising campaigns also benefit from the advantages of parallax scrolling
        for storytelling.

        From a web design point of view, the following points are relevant for the representation of information
        using parallax scrolling[1] :

        Parallax scrolling should be used in a minimalist way if we want to move towards a flat design.
        It should act as a visual storytelling.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>It should give pleasure to the user and no frustration.</li>
        <li>It should push the user towards an action. For example a contact or the order of a product.</li>
        <li>It should be retroactively compatible with older versions of browsers and work without any problems
            on
            mobile browsers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If these criteria are not met when creating a website based on parallax scrolling, the end user may be
        faced with major problems. In the worst case, the website would be unusable, the information impossible
        to consult, and the website would not reach its goal. Too many technical difficulties could frustrate
        the users and also damage the image of the site.
